# Iterative reasoning with bi-directional attention flow for machine comprehension
Code for the Default Final Project (SQuAD) for [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), Winter 2018

Our model combines ideas from some of the best performing SQuAD models like BiDAF and iterative self matching attention along with highway networks and extensive tuning. This model stood 2nd on the class leaderboard with a F1 score of 81.12 for the ensemble of 7 of our models and 2nd among single models as well with a F1 of 78.63
